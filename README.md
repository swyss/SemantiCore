## Data Flow

The data flow in SemantiCore is centered around **Apache Pulsar** as the message broker. This event-driven architecture ensures real-time data exchange between services while maintaining decoupling and scalability.

### Key Flow Components:
1. **Data Integration**:
   - Data from OPC UA, MQTT, and IoT devices is aggregated by the **Data Integration Service**.
   - This service sends processed data as events to **Apache Pulsar** for distribution to other services.

2. **Apache Pulsar**:
   - Publishes and distributes events to microservices subscribed to relevant data streams.
   - Ensures real-time event streaming and queuing for high-throughput processing.

3. **OEE Calculation Service**:
   - Receives real-time machine data through Pulsar and performs calculations on **availability**, **performance**, and **quality**.
   - The results are stored in **PostgreSQL** and visualized in the frontend.

4. **Frontend**:
   - Displays OEE values, KPIs, and machine statuses in real-time through the user interface.

---

## Extended OEE Logic

**OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)** is a critical metric for evaluating manufacturing performance. SemantiCore calculates OEE using three key factors:

1. **Availability**: Measures the proportion of planned production time where machines are running without downtime.
2. **Performance**: Compares actual production speed to the ideal, indicating the efficiency of production processes.
3. **Quality**: Tracks defective products relative to total output, reflecting production quality.

### Extensions:
- **Time-Series Analysis**: OEE data is stored in **InfluxDB** for long-term trend analysis, enabling users to track performance over time.
- **AI Integration**: Future integration with AI for real-time anomaly detection and automated optimization suggestions.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: By analyzing OEE data, SemantiCore can integrate with maintenance systems to predict machine failures and schedule proactive maintenance.

---

## Monitoring Service Extensions

SemantiCore's monitoring system can be extended to provide deeper insights and real-time alerting for system and production process failures.

### Potential Extensions:

1. **Prometheus**: 
   - Integrated for collecting and monitoring system and application metrics.
   - Metrics visualized using **Grafana**, offering user-friendly real-time dashboards.

2. **ELK Stack**:
   - Log aggregation with **Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, and **Kibana** for real-time log analysis.
   - Detects anomalies, analyzes logs, and provides comprehensive error reporting.

3. **Alerting**:
   - Integrates with **Prometheus Alertmanager** or similar tools for real-time notifications when thresholds (e.g., downtime, OEE deviations) are exceeded.

4. **Event-Stream Processing**:
   - Uses **Pulsar Functions** for lightweight event processing directly in the message broker, enabling quick responses to system-critical events.

---

## Additional Key Metrics Beyond OEE

While OEE is an important metric, other key performance indicators (KPIs) offer a broader view of overall production and operational efficiency:

1. **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)**:
   - TCO evaluates the total cost of a system over its lifetime, factoring in acquisition, operating, and maintenance costs. This metric helps assess the financial feasibility of production systems.

2. **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)**:
   - MTBF measures the average operational time between system or machine failures, providing insights into reliability and the need for maintenance scheduling.

3. **MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)**:
   - MTTR reflects the average time required to repair a machine after a failure, highlighting the efficiency of maintenance processes and their impact on production downtime.

4. **Yield**:
   - Yield indicates the percentage of products that meet quality standards. A higher yield indicates efficient processes and fewer defects.

5. **Throughput**:
   - Throughput measures the quantity of products or materials processed within a specific timeframe. This metric reflects production efficiency and is used to evaluate process optimization.

6. **Cpk (Process Capability Index)**:
   - Cpk is a statistical measure of process capability, showing how well a process can produce items within specified limits. A higher Cpk value indicates more consistent quality.

7. **RTY (Rolled Throughput Yield)**:
   - RTY measures the likelihood that a product will pass through the entire production process without defects or rework, providing an aggregated view of process efficiency.

8. **Cycle Time**:
   - Cycle time measures the total time required to produce a unit from start to finish. Reducing cycle time increases throughput and operational efficiency.

9. **SCRAP (Ausschussquote)**:
   - SCRAP measures the percentage of defective products that must be discarded. A high SCRAP rate indicates inefficiencies in production and increased waste.

10. **Capacity Utilization**:
   - This metric reflects the percentage of available production capacity that is actually used. Low capacity utilization may indicate inefficiencies, while high utilization suggests optimized use of resources.

11. **Takt Time**:
   - Takt time is the maximum allowable time to meet production demand, aligning production pace with customer demand.

12. **Downtime**:
   - Downtime refers to periods where machines or systems are unavailable due to failure, maintenance, or other issues. Reducing downtime is essential for maximizing productivity.

13. **Energy Efficiency**:
   - Measures energy consumption relative to the number of units produced, helping companies reduce costs and improve sustainability.

14. **Lead Time**:
   - Lead time reflects the total time from receiving an order to delivering the finished product. Reducing lead time can improve customer satisfaction and competitive advantage.
